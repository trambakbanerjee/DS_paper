What is NEST?
======
Many practical situations involve heterogeneous data where heterogeneity is captured by a nuisance parameter. Effectively pooling information across samples while correctly 
accounting for heterogeneity presents a significant challenge in large-scale estimation problems. NEST addresses this issue by introducing the 
"Nonparametric Empirical Bayes Structural Tweedie" (NEST) estimator, which efficiently estimates the unknown effect sizes and properly adjusts for heterogeneity
via a generalized version of Tweedieâ€™s formula.
